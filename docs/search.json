The data set given is a collection of 36 State of the Nation speeches in South Africa, delivered between 1994 and 2022. The aim of the assignment is to ‘predict the president’ by building a model that takes in as a input a particular sentences and returns a prediction of which president said the sentence. The assignment thus focuses on text mining and manipulation as well as predictive models, particularly focusing on neural networks.

    "text": "Exploratory Data Analysis\nThe first step of the process is to perform some exploratory data to understand what the data looks like and how to proceed with building predictive models. The data is made up of 36 speeches delivered between 1994 and 2022. There are 6 different presidents who delivered these speeches, namely Mandela, de Klerk, Mbkei, Zuma, Motlanthe and Ramaphosa. Some exploration is reuired to check how imbalanced these classes are in terms of how many sentences are linked with each president. Table 1 below indicates the number of sentences associated with each president. It is clear that de Klerk and Motlanthe have much fewer associated sentences, this is expected as each of them only delivered one speech. Because of this, de Klerk and Motlanthe are removed from the analysis. The remaining four classes and still imbalanced with Mandela having the fewest sentences with 1665. To account for this all classes are made to have 1665 sentences and this is done by sampling without replacement 1665 sentences from the remaining three presidents, Mbeki, Zuma and Ramaphosa.\n\n\n\nde Klerk\nMandela\nMbeki\nMotlanthe\nRamaphosa\nZuma\n\n\n\n\n97\n1665\n2419\n266\n2286\n2656\n\n\n\nHaving balanced classes and clean data - can now move to creating a bag of words format"
